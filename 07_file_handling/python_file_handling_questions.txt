1. Basic File Reading and Writing
Write a Python program that:
- Creates a file named 'sample.txt'
- Writes the following lines to it:
  Hello, world!
  Welcome to Python file handling.
  This is the third line.
- Then reads and prints the content of the file line by line.

2. File Modes and Cursor Handling
Write a Python program to:
- Open an existing file 'sample.txt' in append and read mode ('a+')
- Append the line "This line is appended."
- Move the file cursor to the beginning using seek()
- Read and print the entire content.

3. Handling CSV Files
Create a CSV file named 'students.csv' with the following headers and data:
  Name,Age,Grade
  Alice,20,A
  Bob,22,B
  Charlie,21,A
Then write a Python program to:
- Read and display each row
- Count how many students got grade 'A'

4. Exception Handling in File Operations
Write a program that attempts to open a non-existing file 'missing.txt'.
- If the file is not found, catch the exception and print "File not found!"
- Otherwise, read and print its contents.

5. JSON File Handling
Write a Python program to:
- Create a dictionary with some key-value pairs:
    data = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "skills": ["Python", "JavaScript"]}
- Save the dictionary to a file 'data.json'
- Read it back and print the contents
